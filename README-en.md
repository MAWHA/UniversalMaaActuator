# NOTICE！

The 3rdparty GUI client for MaaFramework, Universal Maa Actuator, i.e. U-MA, is coming soon in v1.0.0!

Plentiful features will be available in U-MA, including enhanced Maa job control, pipeline job resource packaging, custom task properties support and visualization, fully taking over device management and job instance management, etc.

Just start **one** U-MA client, then you can easily complete the automatic operation of **multiple** devices with various job terminals!

Hope to see you in U-MA v1.0.0 release soon!

~STAY TUNED~
